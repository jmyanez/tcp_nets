Baby got her head down
Baby got her head down to the ground
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
You gotta dot your I's and cross your T's
You gotta let go, come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You say you want it, but
You can't get it
You got yourself a bad habit for real
Oh look at you, walking up and down the hall
Saying please, stay with me
You say you want it, but
You can't get it
You got yourself a bad habit for real
Oh look at you, walking up and down the hall
Saying please
Oh man, oh man, oh man
You know I wish I had it all

Baby got her head down
Baby tryin' to stand out in the crowd
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
You gotta dot your I's and cross your T's
You gotta let go, come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
